        1. By default, the level will auto-change the type of level that you are using based on the orientation of your phone.
        It will auto-change at about a 45 degree angle.If you wish to change this go into the settings tab in the upper right hand
        conner and change the Locking option to on. After this go back to the level screen and get to the level you want to use and
        tap at the top of the screen to lock that level as the one to use. <br>
        2. You can turn the angle values on and off in the settings as well as switch it from angle to inclinations. <br>
        3. You can change the viscosity of the fluid in the level to make it more or less sensitive in the settings as well. You
        have the options of low, medium, or high. It is set to medium by default.<br>
        4.If the level does not feel that it is calibrated correctly, you can recalibrate it by pressing the calibration button to
