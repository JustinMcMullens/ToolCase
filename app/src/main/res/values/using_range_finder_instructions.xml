        <b>How to use the Range Finder:</b><br>
        1. Select the unit of measurement you would like to use. If no unit is selected it will default to feet. <br>
        *Be aware it can take up to 5 seconds for the unit of measurement to change on screen*<br>
        2. You can save values to the width, length and height variables by just pressing each button accordingly
        to save the current range as the variable. If you want to change the value just repress the button and it
        will save the current range being measured as the new value. <br>
        3. To calculate the area you must have a value saved in both the width and length positions. They must both
        be in the same unit of measurement, meaning both feet or both yards.
        4. To calculate the volume you must have a value saved in width, length and height positions. They must all
        be in the same unit of measurement, meaning all in feet or yards.
